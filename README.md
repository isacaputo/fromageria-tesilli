## Server

2 Routes:

1. products,
2. orders.

**products** - API Routes Folder: /routes/products.js

2 endpoints:

- get all products from products table
- get producst from products table

**orders** - API Routes Folder: /routes/orders.js

2 endpoints:

- get all orders from orders table
- post in orders and order_has_product tables

Actions being performed in the **post endpoint**:

- mapping products that are in the order (mapping by id)
- selecting product_half_price and product_whole_price of the products selected, so with the quantity set in the order it is possible to calculate the total price of each item in the order
- calculating the total amount for each item
- inserting into orders all the data requested in the database
- getting the order_id just inserted into the database so it is possible to fill in the order_has_product table, as it needs product_id and order_id for its primary key
- inserting the items data into the order_has_product table
- getting data from the order and sending an email to the customer
